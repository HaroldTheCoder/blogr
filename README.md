Blogr challenge from Fronend Mentor

This is my first time doing a challenge, and I really enjoyed working on it, I felt I learn a lot, specially with JavaScript. I recently started to study the language and this is the most JavaScript I have done so far, it's not much but it helped me understand more the logic of the language.

Also I put all images and files together because GitHub wasn't reading it if it was in different folders.
