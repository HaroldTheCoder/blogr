Blogr challenge from Fronend Mentor

I had a lot of fun on this challenge, it was the first one for me and I really anjoyed working on it and felt I learn a lot, specially with JavaScript. I recently started to study the language and this is the most JavaScript I have done so far, it's not much but it helped me understand more the logic of the language.

Also I put all images and files together because GitHub wasn't reading it if it was in different folders.
